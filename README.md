## Overview

Moving to a new neighborhood can be quite daunting.

We get it, you've found your dream home. But how will your morning commute be? How safe is the neighborhood? How much is gas? These are just a few of the factors to consider when moving.

Let Locus help you out. Simply type in an address, and Locus curates points of interest, scores quality-of-life metrics, and even locates where you could grab a bite to eat.
